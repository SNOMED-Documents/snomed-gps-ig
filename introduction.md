# Introduction

## Background

SNOMED CT is a comprehensive clinical terminology maintained by SNOMED International and used globally to support interoperable clinical data. Access to the full SNOMED CT terminology, including its hierarchies and logical definitions, requires membership or an Affiliate License.

To support global interoperability across licensing boundaries, SNOMED International provides the Global Patient Set (GPS).

The GPS makes all SNOMED CT concepts accessible worldwide, including in non-Member countries, without compromising the SNOMED CT licensing model.

## Objective

The objective of this guide is to:

* Describe the scope and purpose of the Global Patient Set
* Clarify permitted and non-permitted uses of SNOMED CT content when using the GPS
* Provide implementation guidance for receiving, storing, validating, and exchanging SNOMED CT identifiers
* Support consistent international implementation of the GPS

## Scope

This guide applies to:

* Use of the GPS as a standalone, permissively licensed artifact
* Systems that exchange SNOMED CT identifiers without access to the full SNOMED CT release
* Interoperability scenarios involving Member and non-Member countries
